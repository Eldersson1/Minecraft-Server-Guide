# Hosting
Hosting is the thing you have to do good as a server owner here I have a list of hosts for different purposes you might use your server for.
## Free Providors
_You don't wanna put money in. That's ok._
### Aternos
Oh yeah the good and old. Still one of the best free providors. Aternos is really ok if you: want to play with 1-3 other friends, but still not have to have your PC online. It has Ok performance for a playerbase like that, but it's also a fun optimization challenge if you want to have more than 1-3 players. 
### Minehut
Minehut is a very good host for people who wanna spin up a semi-vanilla server template for 1-3 people. Their automatically starting servers are good for people who just wanna play and not have to mess with the aternos web panel. The - with minehut is the very bad performance. But the biggest upside is they support custom plugins so free way to test those. (also they updated with a 5 hour time limit so if you plan on playing for more than that it's not a good pick.)
### Play.Hosting
A relatively new host. Haven't been able to test yet because of their massive networking issues (part coming soon)
### Selfhost
The original way to make Minecraft servers. If you don't know how to do it I recommend watching a [tutorial](https://youtu.be/VfzkLJ8skew?si=Kw9wzjuPVFV-rk97) on it. It's really useful but you need to setup outside access in some way port-forwarding or other 3rd party routes. It's a fun challenge for a beginner and a good way to host a custom plugin quickly locally. 
### Essential
Not a server host but rather a mod. You take that selfhosting and do it the easy way, only downside is that everyone who wants to join has to have to mod so doesn't really work for public use.
