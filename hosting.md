# Hosting
Hosting is the thing you have to do good as a server owner here I have a list of hosts for different purposes you might use your server for.
## Free Providors
_You don't wanna put money in. That's ok. _
### Aternos
Oh yeah the good and old. Still one of the best free providors. Aternos is really ok if you: want to play with 1-3 other friends, but still not have to have your PC online. It has Ok performance for a playerbase like that, but it's also a fun optimization challenge if you want to have more than 1-3 players.
