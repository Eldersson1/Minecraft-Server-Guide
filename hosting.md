# Hosting
Hosting is the thing you have to do good as a server owner here I have a list of hosts for different purposes you might use your server for.
## Free Providors
_You don't wanna put money in. That's ok._
### Aternos
Oh yeah the good and old. Still one of the best free providors. Aternos is really ok if you: want to play with 1-3 other friends, but still not have to have your PC online. It has Ok performance for a playerbase like that, but it's also a fun optimization challenge if you want to have more than 1-3 players. 
### Minehut
Minehut is a very good host for people who wanna spin up a semi-vanilla server template for 1-3 people. Their automatically starting servers are good for people who just wanna play and not have to mess with the aternos web panel. The - with minehut is the very bad performance. But the biggest upside is they support custom plugins so free way to test those. (also they updated with a 5 hour time limit so if you plan on playing for more than that it's not a good pick.)
### Play.Hosting
A relatively new host. Haven't been able to test yet because of their massive networking issues (part coming soon)
