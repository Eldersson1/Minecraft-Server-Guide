# Hosting
Hosting is the thing you have to do good as a server owner here I have a list of hosts for different purposes you might use your server for.
## Free Providors
_You don't wanna put money in. That's ok._
### Aternos
Oh yeah the good and old. Still one of the best free providors. Aternos is really ok if you: want to play with 1-3 other friends, but still not have to have your PC online. It has Ok performance for a playerbase like that, but it's also a fun optimization challenge if you want to have more than 1-3 players. 
### Minehut
Minehut is a very good host for people who wanna spin up a semi-vanilla server template for 1-3 people. Their automatically starting servers are good for people who just wanna play and not have to mess with the aternos web panel. The - with minehut is the very bad performance. But the biggest upside is they support custom plugins so free way to test those. (also they updated with a 5 hour time limit so if you plan on playing for more than that it's not a good pick.)
### Play.Hosting
A relatively new host. Haven't been able to test yet because of their massive networking issues (part coming soon)
### Selfhost
The original way to make Minecraft servers. If you don't know how to do it I recommend watching a [tutorial](https://youtu.be/VfzkLJ8skew?si=Kw9wzjuPVFV-rk97) on it. It's really useful but you need to setup outside access in some way port-forwarding or other 3rd party routes. It's a fun challenge for a beginner and a good way to host a custom plugin quickly locally. 
### Essential
Not a server host but rather a mod. You take that selfhosting and do it the easy way, only downside is that everyone who wants to join has to have to mod so doesn't really work for public use.
## Semi Premium
_You pay what you play_
### Exaroton
This is in my opinion the best semi premium hosting. When a player tries to join the server and it's offline the server starts booting up and it let's the player know it's starting in a really well designed way. The whole system runs on credits depending on the amount of performance you've selected. You can even create credit pool. If you want to pay for the server together with your friend group. So it's basically Aternos, but for people who want maximum fun (also no ads).
## Premium
Getting to the real stuff. If you're making a public server or really need the performance upgrade with ur friend's massive farms. 
### Lagless.gg
This is the best performing paid host I've used. They have 4 different locations and the prices start at 4$. Their support is extremely helpful and can provide many additional ports. They also have easy scalability if your server starts growing fast you can easily switch to a better plan or even their dedicated hosting. 
### Bisect Hosting
They got really easy server making setup very good for beginners. They have many locations in Europe, Asia and North America. They have a well built easy to use panel. Overall good host for beginners or if you need the 1GB plan for the proxy. 
### Wisehosting
Excellent deals. Beautiful panel and also they tell exactly what plan you should take for what situation. Really respect that! Also best support I've experienced with fast responses.
## Choosing a Plan
Most important part for premium servers. 
- 1-2GB - Just do free hosting or a proxy purpose. 
- 4-6GB - Friends and Small public server. 
- 8-12GB - I really don't recommend getting a plan for one server. Better way is to split for smaller servers with a proxy setup. 
- 16-64 - Big network. Single server will just not probably ever get to that usage so just split it.
