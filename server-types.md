# Choosing a Server Type
So you wanna start a Minecraft Server, but don't really know what's the type. Most servers should stick to a single type before getting like a 1k+ players. Investing time to a single type can really help make the server popular so remember that. 
## Minigames
Oh well the hypixel clones never work so here's a good strategy. Make like 3 games, they can be all custom or very customized popular one's just try and try again and probably one of those is at least gonna be a hit like Hypixel did with Skywars. 
## SMP/Survival
Survival is a really basic core of Minecraft. In this section I'm gonna focus on semi big SMP creation that can easily grow. 2 week Minecraft phases, avoiding it is quite hard, but I think I've nailed it down now. So when making you know that there's the fast pace players that wanna complete the game as fast as possible and then there's the chill players who want to build and have fun, how can you make them work together. MMo Survival's nail it perfectly I really recommend studying them to learn to design a good one. 
## Parkour
Just make some unique maps and maybe even features like launchpads or tridents.
