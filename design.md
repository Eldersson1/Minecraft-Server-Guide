## 🎨 Design

Design is one of the most important parts of a game. Without it, a game loses its fun, replayability, and sense of purpose. This section mainly applies to **minigames** and **SMP servers**, but the principles fit anywhere.

### Understanding Playstyles

A great game thrives on diverse playstyles. Rules aren’t just about restricting behavior — they shape how players interact, compete, and express themselves.

For example, a **speedrunning SMP** might only attract speedrunners at first, making it a niche experience. But with smart design, you can expand that. Imagine adding a **“quality vs. speed”** challenge where fast players race while slower builders compete for creativity or efficiency. Suddenly, you’ve created overlap between different playstyles — and a broader audience.

The key is to **start small**. Focus on one niche and perfect it. When that community feels strong and enjoyable, others will naturally join in. That’s how small, well-built ideas grow into larger, thriving games.

### Building Toward Monetization

Eventually, growth means money — and that’s not a bad thing. Servers cost real resources: hosting, plugins, development, design. You’ll need a way to make income that feels natural and fair.

Avoid the lazy **pay-to-win** approach; it kills long-term fun. Instead, think about **value-based monetization** — ways for players to pay for **experiences**, not raw power.

**Examples:**
- Unlocking a hidden questline or secret level  
- Gaining access to unique lore moments or story scenes  
- Earning special tools through extra effort, not direct purchase  

When players pay to **enrich** the experience — not to skip it — you build trust and longevity. That’s good design, both creatively and economically.
