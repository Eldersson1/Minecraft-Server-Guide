# Mods And Plugins
If ur making a modded server that you likely are. Even if you would want vanilla you would still want to choose modded because of the performance benefits. So here's some ways to do your mods perfectly!
## Platoform
There's a lot of different platforms, choosing the right one will leave you good compatability and performance. 
### Paper
Paper is a fork of spigot. It has evolved a lot and made spigot absolutely obsolete with the performance and features to developers. It's mostly known from its great compatability with other products from the paper team like velocity to make a good working network. **Conclusion: Its good for everything but sometimes it's good to check the other options.**
### Fabric
So you wanna start a modded server. This is mostly for more performance on vanilla or modpack use. All vanilla clitches and farms work on fabric (when no mods applied)
### Velocity
Make a Minecraft server network. Mostly for big server use. Its so much better than bungeecord with it's great security optimizations and the plugin compatability is expanding quickly for it.
### Folia
Paper team's recent project. The plugin compatability at the moment is really bad so if you don't have a dev team, its gonna be a hard time. But it basically makes a single DEDICATED server run extremely well and basically splits the world into different servers. 
### Purpur
This is a highly recommended switch from paper. It's basically paper, with compatability from paper, with pufferfish's insane performance. And on top of all that the **most customizable server software**
### Forge
In short: Really bad performance. Really should be used to host old mods, because those run only on forge.
